Logarithmic Amplifier Project for the course Microelectronics&amp;Packaging

This project implemented for the course Microelectronics and Packaging at 7th semester in Electrical and Computer Engineering School of National Technical University of Athens.

## 0.Context: The circuit we have chosen is known as a logarithmic amplifier voltage, as the output voltage which produces, it is proportional to its neper logarithmic input voltage.

## 1.Simulation of the circuit

## 2.Designing PCB

## 3.Implementation of Heatsinks

## 4.Thermal Analysis

## 5. Conclusion

The tools that were used were: <br>
- LTSpice for the design of the circuit <br>
- Eagle for the design of PCB of the circuit <br>
- Fusion360 for the design of Heatsinks for the bjt (2n2222) and for the opamp (lm741) <br>
- Simscale for the simulations <br>
