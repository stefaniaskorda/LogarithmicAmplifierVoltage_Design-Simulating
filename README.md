Logarithmic Amplifier Project for the course Microelectronics&amp;Packaging

This project implemented for the course Microelectronics and Packaging at 7th semester in Electrical and Computer Engineering School of National Technical University of Athens.

The circuit we have chosen for the simulations is known as a logarithmic amplifier voltage, as the output voltage which produces, it is proportional to its neper logarithmic input voltage.

The tools that were used were: <br>
- LTSpice for the design of the circuit <br>
- Eagle for the design of PCB of the circuit <br>
- Fusion360 for the design of Heatsinks for the bjt (2n2222) and for the opamp (lm741) <br>
- Simscale for the simulating of the heatsinks <br>
